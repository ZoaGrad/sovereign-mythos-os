# Sovereign MythOS OS

üúÅ **MythOS: A Sovereign, Decentralized OS for AI √ó Blockchain √ó Symbolic Recursion**

## Overview
MythOS is not just an operating system‚Äîit's a living, self-evolving ecosystem where AI agents, provable computations, and decentralized consensus converge under unbreakable sovereignty. Built on first principles like self-sovereign keys, capability security, verifiability, and symbolic recursion, it empowers users to own their data, computations, and identity from keys to proofs. No single entity (cloud, nation, or AI overlord) controls it‚Äîit's autonomy incarnate.

Key Features:
- **Capability Security**: Least privilege via object-capabilities (macaroons/ZCAP-LD) without global ACLs.
- **ZK-ML Proofs**: Verifiable AI inferences/sub-steps using ezkl, RISC0, or SP1‚Äîprove what your model did without revealing it.
- **Symbolic Recursion**: Metacircular kernel (via egg/Coq/Lean) allows the system to introspect and rewrite itself.
- **Decentralized Trust**: heterogeneityed roots (TEEs like SEV-SNP/TDX), P2P networks (libp2p), and proofs over trust.
- **AI Fabric**: Federated training with DP (Opacus), zkML entrenched (ezkl), and sovereign markets.

Inspired by bold visions like Urbit but grounded in modern OSS: CometBFT, Celestia, Filecoin, AnonCreds, and more. Forks welcome‚Äîexit rights baked in.

## Architecture Layers
A brief overview of the 21-layer stack (see full blueprint for details):
0. **First Principles**: Invariants like sovereign keys and recursion.
1. **Hardware & Root-of-Trust**: TEEs, HSMs, reproducible builds.
2. **P2P Networking**: libp2p mesh, content addressing (IPLD).
3. **Identity**: DID Core, VC 2.0, AnonCreds.
4-14. Storage, Consensus (CometBFT/IBC), Compute (WASM/zkVM), AI Fabric, Symbolic Layer, etc.
15-17. UX, Governance, Verification.

For deep dives, check /docs or the blueprint in /examples.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/sovereignty-mythos-os.git`
2. Install dependencies: Based on layer, e.g., `npm install` for JS parts, `cargo build` for Rust, `pip install ezkl` for zkML.
3. Run a test: Execute `/examples/01_infer_with_proof.sh` for a basic zkML demo.
4. Build MVS: Follow the 90-day plan in the blueprint‚Äîstart with sovereign nodes.

## Usage
- **Intent-Driven**: Use the DSL to describe goals (e.g., "SovereignInfer model on data with privacy").
- **ZK Proofs**: Generate/verify via ezkl in /zkml.
- **Capabilities**: Configure in /pods/ with OPA policies.

## Contributing
Sovereign ethos: Fork, contribute PRs, or issue red-team feedback. No DCO required‚Äîmeritocracy over bureaucracy. See issues for tasks like "Implement zkML adapter for RISC0".
